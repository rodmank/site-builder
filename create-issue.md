# GitHub Issue Creation Workflow

This command helps create well-structured GitHub issues for ConvertX following the project's established format and conventions.

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new issue (will prompt for details)
./create-issue.md

# Create a specific type of issue
./create-issue.md feature    # Feature request/enhancement
./create-issue.md bug        # Bug report
./create-issue.md docs       # Documentation improvement
./create-issue.md question   # Support/question
./create-issue.md external   # External dependency issue
```

## Issue Creation Process

### Step 1: Determine Issue Type

**Arguments provided**: Use the specified type ($ARGUMENTS)

**No arguments**: Ask user to select:

4. **Priority Level**: Low/Medium/High
5. **Sprint/Phase**: Which sprint/phase should this target?
6. **Dependencies**: Are there any blocking issues or requirements?
7. **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know it's complete?

#### For Bug Issues:

1. **Bug Summary**: Brief description of the problem
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: How to recreate the issue
3. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
4. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
5. **Environment**: OS, browser, version details

8. **Error Messages**: Any specific error messages or logs

#### For Documentation Issues:

1. **Documentation Area**: Which docs need improvement?
2. **Issue Type**: Missing/Incorrect/Unclear/Outdated

### Step 4: Assign Labels and Metadata

Based on the issue type and content, assign appropriate labels:

#### Feature/Enhancement:

- `enhancement` (primary)
- `good first issue` (if suitable for newcomers)
- `help wanted` (if community help is desired)

#### Bug:

- `bug` (primary)
- `can reproduce` or `can't reproduce` (once investigated)
- `good first issue` (if simple bug fix)

#### Documentation:

- `documentation` (primary)
- `good first issue` (if straightforward docs update)
- `help wanted` (if community help is desired)

#### Question:

- `question` (primary)
- `help wanted` (if community input is needed)

#### External:

- `external issue` (primary)
- `help wanted` (if community help is needed)

### Step 5: Create GitHub Issue

Use the GitHub CLI to create the issue:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[EMOJI] [ISSUE_TITLE]" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
[GENERATED_ISSUE_CONTENT]
EOF
)" \
  --label "[LABEL1,LABEL2,LABEL3]" \
  --assignee "[ASSIGNEE_IF_SPECIFIED]"
```

### Step 6: Confirmation and Next Steps

After creating the issue:

1. Display the issue URL
2. Ask if user wants to:
   - Create a related PRD (using `create-prd.md`)
   - Start implementing immediately (using `issue.md`)
   - Create additional related issues
